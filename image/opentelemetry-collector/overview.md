## About the OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector (otelcol) is a vendor-agnostic telemetry pipeline that receives, processes, and exports
traces, metrics, and logs. It is commonly deployed as a standalone gateway or an agent alongside applications to
centralize telemetry collection, apply processing (sampling, batching), and forward data to backends such as Prometheus,
Tempo, Jaeger, or commercial APMs. Official documentation: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/
