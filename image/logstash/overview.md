## About Logstash

Logstash is an open source data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and forwards data from a wide variety of
sources to your preferred destination. It is commonly used for collecting logs, metrics, and other event data for
observability and security workflows.

Logstash is part of the Elastic Stack and works seamlessly with Elasticsearch and Kibana. It supports a rich ecosystem
of input, filter, and output plugins, allowing you to build complex data pipelines with minimal configuration. Pipelines
are defined using a simple configuration syntax, and Logstash supports dynamic reloading of these pipeline
configurations.
