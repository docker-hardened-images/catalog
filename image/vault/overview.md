## About Vault

Vault is HashiCorp's centralized secrets management solution that securely stores, manages, and controls access to
sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. It provides a consistent API and tooling
for secret retrieval, encryption-as-a-service, and identity-based access across distributed systems.

Vault supports dynamic secrets that are generated on-demand—like database credentials—along with automated secret
revocation and rotation. Access control is enforced through flexible policy definitions, and all access events are
logged for auditability and compliance.

With its pluggable architecture, Vault integrates into diverse environments including Kubernetes, cloud platforms, and
legacy systems, making it ideal for securing modern application infrastructure and automating secrets management across
development and production environments.
