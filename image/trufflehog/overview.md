## About TruffleHog

TruffleHog is a comprehensive secrets scanning tool that finds credentials, API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data
across multiple sources including git repositories, filesystems, S3 buckets, GitHub, GitLab, and more. Written in Go,
TruffleHog is fast, accurate, and designed for enterprise-scale security scanning.

Unlike traditional regex-based scanners, TruffleHog uses both pattern matching and entropy analysis to detect secrets,
and includes built-in verification for over 700 credential types. This allows it to not only find potential secrets but
also verify if they are active and valid.

With extensive integrations and a powerful detection engine, TruffleHog is trusted by security teams and developers
worldwide to prevent credential leaks and secure their software supply chain.
