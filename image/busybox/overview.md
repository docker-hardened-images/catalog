## About BusyBox

With a minimal size, [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/)⁠ is a very good ingredient to craft space-efficient
distributions.

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements
for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have
fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected
functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any
small or embedded system.
