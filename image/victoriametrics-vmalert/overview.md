## About VictoriaMetrics VMAlert

VictoriaMetrics VMAlert is a component of the VictoriaMetrics monitoring stack. Its primary function is to evaluate
alerting and recording rules against time series data stored in a Prometheus-compatible data source (such as
VictoriaMetrics or Prometheus itself). VMAlert continuously checks these rules and, when conditions are met, sends
alerts to configured alert managers or external systems.
