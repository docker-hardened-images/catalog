## About Karpenter

Karpenter is an open source Kubernetes node autoscaler that helps you improve cluster efficiency and reduce costs. It
automatically launches just-in-time compute resources in response to pending pods, and can consolidate under-utilized
nodes to optimize for price and performance. Karpenter works with any Kubernetes cluster, and has provider-specific
implementations for major clouds such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.

This Docker Hardened Image packages the Karpenter controller, which runs inside your cluster to perform node management.
