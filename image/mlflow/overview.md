## About mlflow

MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle: experiment tracking, reproducible
runs, model packaging, and model deployment. The mlflow DHI image provides the mlflow CLI and server runtime packaged
for secure, production-ready container deployments.

Common use cases include running a central tracking server (mlflow server) backed by a relational backend (Postgres) and
an artifact store (S3/MinIO), packaging models as containers, and serving models for inference.
