## About PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose
programming language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web
frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the
web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI).
