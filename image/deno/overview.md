## About Deno

Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is secure by default. Built on V8, Rust, and Tokio, Deno
provides a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern programmer.

Unlike other JavaScript runtimes, Deno has secure defaults. Code is run in a secure sandbox by default, and explicit
permission must be granted for file, network, and environment access. This makes Deno ideal for running untrusted code
or building secure applications.

Deno has first-class TypeScript support—no configuration needed. TypeScript code runs directly in Deno without a
separate compilation step. Deno also includes a comprehensive standard library, built-in testing framework, code
formatter, linter, and bundler, providing a complete development toolchain out of the box.

Deno is compatible with Node.js and npm packages, allowing developers to leverage the existing JavaScript ecosystem
while benefiting from Deno's modern features and security model.
