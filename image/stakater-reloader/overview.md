## About Stakater Reloader

Stakater Reloader is a Kubernetes controller that automatically triggers application restarts when associated ConfigMaps
or Secrets are updated, ensuring configuration changes take effect immediately. It monitors resources like Deployments,
StatefulSets, and DaemonSets, helping eliminate manual restarts and reducing configuration drift in dynamic
environments.
