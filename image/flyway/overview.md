## About Flyway

Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that enables you to reliably evolve your database schema. It works by
checking the current version of the database and applying new migrations automatically. It strongly favors simplicity
and convention over configuration.

Flyway supports both SQL-based migrations and Java-based migrations. SQL migrations are the most common type of
migration and the most straightforward. It is most commonly used via the command line tool to migrate the database on
application startup. Java-based migrations are useful when you need to perform transformations of data that would be too
complex for SQL.
