## About Prometheus Operator Admission Webhook

The Prometheus Operator Admission Webhook provides validation and mutation of Prometheus-related custom resources in
Kubernetes. This component acts as a validating and mutating admission webhook that ensures Prometheus, Alertmanager,
and other monitoring resource configurations are valid before they are persisted to the Kubernetes API server. It helps
prevent misconfigurations and enforces best practices for monitoring deployments, enhancing the reliability and security
of the overall monitoring infrastructure.
