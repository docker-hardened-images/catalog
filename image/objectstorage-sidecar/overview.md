## About Kubernetes COSI Sidecar

The Kubernetes COSI (Container Object Storage Interface) sidecar is a provisioner component that manages object storage
bucket lifecycle by coordinating with COSI drivers. It acts as a bridge between the Kubernetes control plane and COSI
drivers, enabling dynamic provisioning of object storage resources through Unix domain socket communication.
