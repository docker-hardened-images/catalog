## About CouchDB

Apache CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query
language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API. CouchDB was first released in 2005 and later became an Apache project in
2008\.

CouchDB is designed for reliability and ease of use. It provides a RESTful HTTP API for reading and updating database
documents. CouchDB's replication protocol enables data synchronization between databases, making it well-suited for
distributed, offline-first applications. The database employs multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to avoid locking
the database during writes, ensuring high availability and scalability.
