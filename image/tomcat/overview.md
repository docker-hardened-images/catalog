## About Apache Tomcat

Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications from Oracle, and
provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in. In the simplest config Tomcat runs in a
single operating system process. The process runs a Java virtual machine (JVM). Every single HTTP request from a browser
to Tomcat is processed in the Tomcat process in a separate thread.
