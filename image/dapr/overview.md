## About Dapr

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to
build resilient, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr provides APIs for building
portable applications using any language or framework.

Dapr's building blocks include:
- **Service-to-service invocation** - Resilient service-to-service invocation enables method calls, including retries,
  on remote services, wherever they are located.
- **State management** - Provides state management capabilities for transactions and CRUD operations.
- **Publish and subscribe** - Enables pub/sub messaging between services.
- **Bindings** - Enables external systems and events to trigger your applications.
- **Actors** - A pattern for stateful and stateless objects with simple turn-based access.
- **Observability** - Distributed tracing, metrics, and logging.
- **Secrets** - Securely access secrets from your application.
- **Configuration** - Access application configuration and receive updates.
- **Distributed lock** - Enables distributed locks for concurrent access.
- **Workflows** - Orchestrate complex workflows with built-in durability.
- **Cryptography** - Perform cryptographic operations.
