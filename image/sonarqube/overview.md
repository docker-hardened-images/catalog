## About SonarQube

SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality that performs automatic reviews with
static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities across more than 25 programming
languages. Originally developed by SonarSource, SonarQube has become the industry standard for code quality management.

SonarQube provides comprehensive code analysis capabilities including security vulnerability detection, maintainability
assessment, reliability analysis, and code coverage reporting. Its powerful quality gates ensure that only code meeting
defined quality standards passes through to production. The platform integrates seamlessly with popular CI/CD tools,
IDEs, and version control systems, making it an essential component of modern DevOps workflows.

Common use cases include automated code review in CI/CD pipelines, technical debt management, security vulnerability
scanning, compliance reporting, and establishing quality standards across development teams. SonarQube supports both
community and commercial editions, with enterprise features including branch analysis, pull request decoration, and
advanced security rules.
