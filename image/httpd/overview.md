## About Apache HTTP Server

The Apache HTTP Server (httpd) is a robust, extensible, and widely used web server for serving static and dynamic
content. It supports modular extensions, virtual hosting, SSL/TLS, and a wide range of deployment scenarios from simple
static sites to complex reverse-proxy and application server frontends.
