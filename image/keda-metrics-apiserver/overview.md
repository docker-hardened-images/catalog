## About KEDA

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is an open-source project that provides event-driven autoscaling for
Kubernetes workloads. It allows you to scale your applications based on the number of events needing to be processed,
rather than just CPU or memory usage.

KEDA works by integrating with various event sources, such as message queues, HTTP triggers, and more. It can
automatically scale your Kubernetes deployments up or down based on the rate of incoming events, ensuring that your
applications can handle varying workloads efficiently.
