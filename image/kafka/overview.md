## About Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of
events per day. Originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as an Apache project, Kafka has become the de
facto standard for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

Kafka provides a high-throughput, low-latency publish-subscribe messaging system that stores streams of records in
categories called topics. Its distributed architecture ensures fault tolerance through data replication across multiple
brokers, making it highly reliable for mission-critical applications. Common use cases include real-time analytics, log
aggregation, stream processing, event sourcing, and serving as the central nervous system for modern data architectures.
