## About MongoDB Controllers for Kubernetes (MCK)

Mongodb Controllers for Kubernetes (MCK) is a Kubernetes operator that enables users to run MongoDB in Kubernetes. MCK
is a single Operator that supports running both MongoDB Community and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in Kubernetes, and
serves as a unified replacement for:

- [MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/current/)
- [MongoDB Community Operator](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator)

MCK provides a seamless migration path from existing operators, and your MongoDB deployments are not impacted by the
upgrade and require no change. Future versions of MCK will more closely align how Community and Enterprise are managed
in Kubernetes to offer an even more seamless and streamlined experience.
