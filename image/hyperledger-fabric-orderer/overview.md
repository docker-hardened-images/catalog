## About Hyperledger Fabric Orderer

Hyperledger Fabric Orderer is a hardened, minimal image that includes the Orderer service for Hyperledger Fabric
networks. The Hyperledger Fabric ordering service provides an atomic broadcast ordering service for consumption by the
peers. This means that many clients can submit messages to the ordering service, and the same sequence of ordered
batches will be delivered to all clients in response.

For complete usage guidance and tutorials, see the Hyperledger Fabric documentation at
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/.
