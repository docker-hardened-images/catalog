## About Kyverno Policy Reporter

Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that enables platform and security teams to validate, mutate, generate, and
enforce policies using familiar YAML. It integrates with Kubernetes admission controllers and background scans to
automate security, compliance, and operational guardrails.

The Kyverno Policy Reporter adds observability and monitoring possibilities to cluster security based on the
PolicyReport CRDs. It provides common features including metrics, a web based user interface, notification pushes,
integrations with tools like Grafana or SecurityHub, email reports and more.
