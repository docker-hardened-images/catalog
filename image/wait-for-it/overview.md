## About wait-for-it

wait-for-it is a pure bash script that waits for the availability of a TCP host and port. It is useful for synchronizing
the spin-up of interdependent services, such as linked Docker containers or applications that need to wait for a
database, message queue, or other service to be ready before starting.

The script is lightweight, has no external dependencies beyond bash, and is widely used in Docker Compose setups and
Kubernetes init containers to ensure proper startup sequencing.
