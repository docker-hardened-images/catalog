## About Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed for reliability and scalability. It collects
metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, evaluates rule-based conditions, and triggers alerts when
thresholds are crossed.

Metrics in Prometheus are stored as time series data, with each data point tagged by a timestamp and optional
labels—key-value pairs that provide context such as host, service, or environment. Prometheus supports a powerful query
language called PromQL, which lets you aggregate, filter, and analyze metric data in real time.
