## About OAuth2 Proxy

OAuth2 Proxy is a reverse proxy and static file server that provides authentication using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
providers such as Google, GitHub, Azure, and others. It is commonly used to secure web applications and services by
acting as an authentication gateway, requiring users to authenticate before accessing upstream services.

OAuth2 Proxy supports a wide range of providers and is highly configurable via environment variables, command-line
flags, or a configuration file. It is suitable for use with Kubernetes, Docker, and other containerized environments.
