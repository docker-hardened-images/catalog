## About Python

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming language. It incorporates modules,
exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very
clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is
extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.
