## About kserve-controller

KServe provides a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition for serving machine learning (ML) models on arbitrary
frameworks. It aims to solve production model serving use cases by providing performant, high abstraction interfaces for
common ML frameworks like Tensorflow, XGBoost, ScikitLearn, PyTorch, and ONNX. It encapsulates the complexity of
autoscaling, networking, health checking, and server configuration to bring cutting edge serving features like GPU
Autoscaling, Scale to Zero, and Canary Rollouts to your ML deployments. It enables a simple, pluggable, and complete
story for Production ML Serving including prediction, pre-processing, post-processing and explainability.

KServe is an incubation-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation. KServe provides a Kubernetes Custom Resource
Definition for serving predictive and generative machine learning (ML) models. It aims to solve production model serving
use cases by providing high abstraction interfaces for Tensorflow, XGBoost, ScikitLearn, PyTorch, Huggingface
Transformer/LLM models using standardized data plane protocols. For more details, visit
