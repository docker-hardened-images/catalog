## About Kyverno Init

Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that enables platform and security teams to validate, mutate, generate, and
enforce policies using familiar YAML. It integrates with Kubernetes admission controllers and background scans to
automate security, compliance, and operational guardrails.

The Kyverno Init is used by the admissions controller as an init container to run pre-checks and leader selection before
it starts.
