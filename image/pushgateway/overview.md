## About Pushgateway

The Prometheus Pushgateway accepts metrics from ephemeral or batch jobs and exposes them for scraping by Prometheus. It
provides a simple HTTP API for pushing metrics and supports optional persistence to survive restarts.

Common use cases include short-lived job instrumentation, CI/CD job reporting, and batch-processing metric exposure that
cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus.
