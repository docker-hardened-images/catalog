## About the Velero plugin for GCP

The Velero plugin for GCP is an extension that adds support for using Google Cloud Storage as a backup storage location
for Velero. It enables Velero to store and retrieve backups, snapshots, and related metadata in Google Cloud
environments.

This plugin is designed to be used with the Docker Hardened Velero image. You must mirror both the hardened Velero image
repository and the GCP plugin repository before installing Velero with this plugin.

For more information about Velero, visit the upstream docs at https://velero.io/docs/main/.
