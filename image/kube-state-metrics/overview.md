## About kube-state-metrics

kube-state-metrics is an add-on agent for Kubernetes clusters that generates and exposes cluster-level metrics. It
listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects such as deployments,
nodes, pods, and other resources.

The metrics are exposed on an HTTP endpoint (default port 8080 at `/metrics`) in Prometheus format, making it easy to
integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana. kube-state-metrics is particularly useful for alerting on
cluster issues such as pods stuck in Terminating state, querying cluster state like counting pods not ready, and gaining
visibility into the overall health and state of Kubernetes resources.
