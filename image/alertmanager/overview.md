## About Alertmanager

Prometheus Alertmanager receives alerts from Prometheus servers, deduplicates and groups them, and routes notifications
to configured receivers such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, or webhooks. It supports silencing, inhibition, and
high-availability clustering to ensure reliable delivery of notifications in production environments.
