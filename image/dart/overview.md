## About Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google for building fast apps on any platform. It is an
object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax that supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to native code
and just-in-time (JIT) compilation for development. Dart is the foundation of the Flutter framework and provides
features such as null safety, async/await, and a rich standard library.
