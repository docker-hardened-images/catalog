## About Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers and DevOps teams to build, test, and deploy software
efficiently. It supports distributed builds across multiple machines or containers and integrates with virtually any
version control system and build tool. Jenkins is widely used for continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines, automating repetitive tasks, and orchestrating complex workflows.

As a Docker Hardened Image, this Jenkins container provides a secure, production-ready foundation for your CI/CD
infrastructure. It includes hardened security configurations, minimal CVE exposure, and comes with complete provenance
and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) metadata for supply chain security.

## About Docker Hardened Images

Docker Hardened Images are built to meet the highest security and compliance standards. They provide a trusted
foundation for containerized workloads by incorporating security best practices from the start.

### Why use Docker Hardened Images?

These images are published with near-zero known CVEs, include signed provenance, and come with a complete Software Bill
of Materials (SBOM) and VEX metadata. They're designed to secure your software supply chain while fitting seamlessly
into existing Docker workflows.
