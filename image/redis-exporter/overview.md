## About Redis Exporter

Redis Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for monitoring Valkey and Redis servers. It collects internal metrics from Redis
instances and exposes them at an HTTP endpoint that Prometheus can scrape.

Redis Exporter exports information about memory usage, key counts, client connections, replication status, and more. You
can also configure it to export values and sizes of specific keys, streams, or key groups.
