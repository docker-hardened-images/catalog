## About Kustomize

Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched
and usable as is. It is a configuration management tool for Kubernetes that allows you to manage application
configurations across different environments without templates. Kustomize uses a base-and-overlay structure to help you
maintain Kubernetes manifests for development, staging, and production environments.
