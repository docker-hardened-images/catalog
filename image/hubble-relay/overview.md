## About Hubble Relay

Hubble Relay is a component within the Cilium ecosystem that enables cross-cluster Hubble connectivity via a distributed
networking datapath. It aggregates observability data from multiple Hubble instances, providing a centralized view of
network flows and visibility across Kubernetes clusters. Hubble Relay acts as a gRPC-based relay server that collects
flow data from Hubble peers and exposes it through a unified API for visualization and analysis.
