## About Traefik

Traefik⁠ is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and ingress controller that makes deploying microservices easy.

Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Kubernetes⁠, Docker⁠, Swarm⁠, Consul⁠, Nomad⁠, etcd⁠,
Amazon ECS⁠, etc.) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.

Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the only configuration step you need.
