## About Jsonnet

Jsonnet is a data-templating language for defining JSON data programmatically. It extends JSON with features from modern
programming languages such as variables, functions, imports, and conditionals, enabling you to manage complex
configurations and reduce duplication.

Jsonnet is commonly used for generating configuration files for Kubernetes, Terraform, monitoring systems, and other
infrastructure tooling. Its support for code reuse and composability makes it a powerful alternative to static JSON or
YAML files.

Jsonnet files are evaluated to produce pure JSON or YAML outputs, making them easy to integrate into automation
pipelines. The language has a small core and is designed for clarity and correctness.
