## About Trino

Trino is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous
data sources.

It is a tool designed to efficiently query vast amounts of data using distributed queries. Trino was designed as an
alternative to tools that query HDFS using pipelines of MapReduce jobs, such as Hive or Pig, but Trino is not limited to
accessing HDFS. Trino can be and has been extended to operate over different kinds of data sources, including
traditional relational databases and other data sources such as Cassandra.

Trino was designed to handle data warehousing and analytics: data analysis, aggregating large amounts of data and
producing reports. These workloads are often classified as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
