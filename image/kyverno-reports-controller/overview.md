## About Kyverno Reports Controller

Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that enables platform and security teams to validate, mutate, generate, and
enforce policies using familiar YAML. It integrates with Kubernetes admission controllers and background scans to
automate security, compliance, and operational guardrails.

The Kyverno Reports Controller is the **compliance and observability engine** of the Kyverno policy management
ecosystem. It provides comprehensive policy violation reporting and continuous compliance monitoring without any
enforcement or resource modification.
