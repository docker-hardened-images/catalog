Fluentd is an open-source data collector designed to unify the logging layer across systems. It collects, filters,
transforms, and routes logs from various sources (like applications, containers, or servers) to destinations such as
Elasticsearch, S3, or databases.

It’s highly configurable via plugins and is commonly used in cloud-native environments (like Kubernetes) for centralized
and structured logging.
