## About MongoDB Exporter

MongoDB Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for MongoDB including sharding, replication and storage engines. This
implementation handles ALL metrics exposed by MongoDB monitoring commands and loops over all the fields exposed in
diagnostic commands to extract data from them.

The exporter supports MongoDB Community and Enterprise Edition versions 4.4 and newer, including Percona Server for
MongoDB. It can monitor standalone instances, replica sets, and sharded clusters, providing comprehensive observability
for MongoDB deployments.
