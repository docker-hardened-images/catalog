## About Gradle

Gradle⁠ is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are
building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support
the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to
support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and
is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and
Jenkins.
